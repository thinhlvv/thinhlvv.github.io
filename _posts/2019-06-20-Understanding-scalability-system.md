title: Design Architecture: Part 1. Understanding Scalability
---

This article will walk throw these below concerns:

	### When do you need to make decision to scale your system?

When you was handed over a source code but too complicated and confused to maintain.

When you check your server heal and see a lot of peaks and CPU up and down frequently.

When you see your 4xx/5xx requests is more than your daily meal.

Or you just want to provide bunch of features to your customers and make your system available.

If you find yourself in those, make a proposal to your boss or your team to make the scalability happens.

### Understand your system first 

Understanding your system is most important part before you think to somethings like distributed database, load-balancing …

If your system is kind of read-system, focus on your cache server and cache behaviours. If it’s a realtime system with socket, 
do build Pub/Sub system to handle that huge dataset. 

Investigate the APIs those are most frequently and append them to your consideration.
 
### General view with architecture and trade-offs

Once we finish those, let’s see how we can approach the very basic primer to find out your most affordable to you.

- Vertical scaling

	Just add more weapon (RAM, CPU) to your application server. 
	
- Horizontal scaling

	Add more server to handle request, of course you need ha-proxy to direct your requests.
	
- Caching

	Need to observe request behaviours to decide caching strategy.
	
- Load balancing

	For high traffic system to direct the requests between servers.
	
- Database replication

	Improve availability for system.
	
	Improves the performance for retrieval of global queries as the result can be obtained locally from any of the local site
	
- Database partitioning 

	Sharding your database is most popular to partition your database to improve your queries.
	
	Need to divide your dataset strategy into partitions.
