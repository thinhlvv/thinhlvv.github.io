[Blog] 6 daily habits make you to become senior developer.

As much I observed a lot of senior developers or tech lead, as many tips I find out to change our profile LinkedIn with Senior Software Engineer.
Here is some main habits that I noted: 

1. Take Responsibility 
2. Read commits
3. Write Small methods
4. Give meaningful names
5. Always think about how to improve yourself 
    1. Read book
    2. Design pattern
    3. Learn leetcode
6. Guide someone.

TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
This tip is most important in the list. What I have learned from is Senior Developers / Tech Lead (SD/TL) is they are quite proactive with their job. They work with high responsibility with their works.

READ COMMITS
When we work in team with 3-5 people or more in repo, the only thing you can catch up the logics is reading every commits and files changed. It's not only duty in project, you can learn from others code and found some bad code.

WRITE SMALL METHODS and GIVE MEANINGFUL NAMES
Always think about this if you want to reduce complaints when reviewing code or inherit to new comer.

ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOURSELF 
As short time you realised your code smell as fast you growing up. Good people never stick themselves into their safe zone, always staying hungry staying foolish is reason why they are better than yesterday.
I was exhausted with my mentor before because he comsumed lots of things day by day, the following month he always applied new lib, framework or pattern. That also how the world changing nowaday. Be a better version of yourself.

GUIDE SOMEONE 
Learn soft skills and help you work as team efficency.
Test you knowledge and handle edge cases of problem. Guiding is not only helping others, it also helps you to build your confidence anyway.
