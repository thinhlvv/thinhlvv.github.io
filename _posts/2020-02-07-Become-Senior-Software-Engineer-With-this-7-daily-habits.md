[Blog] 7 habits make you to become senior developer.

As much I observed a lot of senior developers or tech lead, as many tips I find out to confidently change our profile LinkedIn with Senior Software Engineer.
Here is some main habits that I noted:

1. Take Responsibility
  - Responsibility to reply issue that happenning
  - Explain to everyone what's happening
2. Problem Solving
  - Framework/Lib solution
  - Technical solution
  - Infrastructure solution
3. Soft Skills
  - Communication skill
  - Pull Request discussion
  - How to collaborate with others and protect your statement
  - Explanation of everythings
4. Clean code
  - Unit test and well documented
  - Write readable code
  - Build CI/CD + code linter
  - Clean codebook recommended
5. Build side projects
  - Learn new tech by building projects
  - Read other's code to better writing good code
6. Always think about how to improve yourself
  - The code we wrote yesterday will become antiques after a dream or after the article you just read.
  - Read book
  - Design pattern
  - Learn algorithms
  - Learn new tech
7. Guide someone.
  - Steady your knowledge
  - Learn how to explain complex things in a simple way
  - Reflect yourself with stupid questions

*Notes*: If you want to move one more step in your career, try to learn management skill. You would say I was wrong when you want to build the technical career path instead of management stuff. Imagine yourself as a technical lead with team of 10+ people, and ask how to run the process smoothly with 10+ different characteristic. Whether you want to be recognized, you must learn the management skill.

TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
What I have learned from Senior Developers / Tech Lead (SD/TL) is they are always proactive with their job. They work with high responsibility to handle every issue.
Responsibility is a scary word, since you will face to depression when people react to what you've done. Getting over and being brave will make you growing up day by day.
Embrace more interaction with issues and tasks will help you archive more ownership of your code and technical debts of your business. 

PROBLEM-SOLVING
  - Technology Solutions (Framework, Libraries...)
  Trying many different frameworks/libraries is good, but being master one of them is the key you understand how it works so far. Youself or your colleagues will always ask many questions about the reason we approach those technologies, indeed understanding will help you to explain to the team.
  - Infrastructure Solutions
  There is not correct solution for all system, trade-off what you have and deal with it. Don't be over automic thinking, sacrify portion that stopping you reach the goal.
  You don't need to be experienced in a lot of kind of systems, what you need is knowledge to solve the problem. I recommend you to read system design topic on leetcode, read book as much as possible, prepare good basic of complexity of algorithms.
  
CLEAN CODE
  - Clean code is also a name of the popular book, which you should read to write good.
  - When we work in a team with 3-5 people or more in the repository, the only thing you can catch up with the logic is reading every commits and file changed. It's not only duty in the project, you can learn from others code and found some bad code.
  - There are some takeaway key points in the book:
    - Unit test and well documented
    - Write readable code
    - Build CI/CD + code linter
    - Investigate design pattern.

WRITE SMALL METHODS and GIVE MEANINGFUL NAMES
Always think about this if you want to reduce complaints when reviewing code or inherit to a newcomer.

ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOURSELF
As short time you realized your code smell as fast you growing up. Good people never stick themselves into their safe zone, always staying hungry staying foolish is the reason why they are better than yesterday.
I was exhausted with my mentor before because he consumed lots of things day by day, the following month he always applied new lib, framework or pattern. That also how the world-changing nowaday. Be a better version of yourself.

GUIDE SOMEONE
Learn soft skills and help you work as team efficiency.
Test your knowledge and handle edge cases of the problem. Guiding is not only helping others, it also helps you to build your confidence anyway.
